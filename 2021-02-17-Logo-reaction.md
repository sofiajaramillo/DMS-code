## LOGO

Working with LOGO was a bit nostalgic. It reminded me of when I initally started to learn coding with a turtle drawing program in python. I'm not sure how related both programs are, but the fact that they share the same turtle object and the some of the same commands makes me believe there is a connection somewhere.

I'm always been a big fan of pixel art so I found the process of making these drawings charming. A lot of the things I made were simple shapes and patterns. I didn't get to experiment with different colors, but the black and white aesthethic is something I find appealing so I didn't really mind.

I did find the process a bit more frustrating than I thought. This is because, despite the commands being fairly simple and easy to remember, the process of drawing something even relatively simple can take forever. This is mainly becuase of the need to specify the rotation, which not only takes up time but can be a bit disorienting, causing me to sometimes make wrongful turns. I do have to admit that making mistakes can some times led to fun discoveries so at least there's that.

When making this small, simple sunset drawing, it took me more time than I'm willing to admit to actually
draw it all out. This is because I wasn't aware of there being a command for erasing or putting the pen up, so every time I made a mistake, I cleared the screen and started all over. I did eventually figure it out, but it was annoying. I think the experience would have been way easier if there was a function to tell the coordinates of the pointer so that fixing mistakes would not be such a hassle.
