## Working with Hydra

I found my time working with Hydra to be fairly pleasant. 

I found myself surprised with how simplistic the program is, or at least looks at first. This comes in terms of the program having only a couple of options, and most of the screen being composed of the visuals.
I feel like the way it was designed makes it easy for outsiders to play with the program and experiment. And despite it being a bit odd to have all the documentation, or helpful pages, separate, I think it's emphasis on fairly simple syntax and a quick code to visuals aesthethic makes up for it.

At first, I was a bit taken aback by the lack of knowledge, such as in Tidal Cycles, but I quickly grasped the layout of the code as well as some of the simple functions. Since it's all visuals, it's easier for me to grasp what is going on, at least in terms of what functions do and how they work with one another. 

And the functions were all very different and fun to work with. My first work with Hydra reflects how I was playing around with the simple functions of kaleidoscope, shape and rotate:


Quickly after, I played around with the layer function, which I think is a great feature to be experimented with, and I got some cool deviations, such as:


Aside from that, I was also interested in the voronoi function, and I played with that a bit. I really wanted to see what I can come up
