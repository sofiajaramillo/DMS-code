## Emergence

The first thing that came to my mind in terms of emergence was the general concept of ants, termites, and their colonies and mounds. I say this because of emergence seems pretty aplicable to how these tiny insects work. As tiny and simple creature, each individual ant is not very important, only each having a specific job within the order of ant colonies. 

I find the topic of emergence still relevant when it comes to ants despite them being actual living things. I think despite emergence being more obvious to see in articial objects, like robots and a.i's, this concept of a higher purporse of being and doing can be applied to anything, regardless of if it's living or not. It really makes you wonder, if ants can achieve such a higher function while probably being unaware, do humans also have a higher function only visible to a higher being?
