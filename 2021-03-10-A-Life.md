## Emergence

The first thing that came to my mind in terms of emergence was the general concept of ants, termites, and their colonies and mounds. I say this because of emergence seems pretty aplicable to how these tiny insects work. As tiny and simple creatures, each individual ant is not very important, only each having a specific job within the order of ant colonies. Each termite has a basic function, foraging, breeding, building, and each ant is probably unaware of what they're doing aside from the idea that they have to do it, it's their purpose. They are "coded" for their simple jobs, by who? who knows! 

But the interesting thing is that we, looking from the outside as more intelligent life forms, can identify and analyze what they do. Despite them doing simple work, all their efforts adds up to create a large intricate mound, with tons of tunnels, airways, crevices. Basically they all work together to create this large, complex and well designed system. And this is all without any of them knowing what they're doing. This is what I see as emergence, this concept of all this components having small jobs, actions, which all ultimately add up for a higher purpose, like all the cogs in a machine.

I find the topic of emergence still relevant when it comes to ants despite them being actual living things. I think despite emergence being more obvious to see in articial objects, like robots and a.i's, this concept of a higher purporse of being and doing can be applied to anything, regardless of if it's living or not. It really makes you wonder, if ants can achieve such a higher function while probably being unaware, do humans also have a higher function only visible to a higher being?


Out of all the projects out there that I looked at so far, I find Heather Dewey's "Bugs" as one of the best examples as to what I think emergence is. Here, the creator has made a system of different components in the form of robotic bugs, that shine in respond to each other. They are encoded with simple instructions, and depend of each other to "live", and overall, their interactions leads to a higher purpose, that of a complex light system. This compares well with my example of termites, and the only difference being that the termites are actually alive. But the idea is still there, of components having a higher purpose.


It was actually kind hard for me to find examples of works that showcase this idea of emergence, at least from what I find to be emergence. Most of the stuff I found resembling emergence were various games, such as simple simulation games that got close to this concept. Such as civilization building games (like ), survival games, or casual sandbox games, mainly games that involved many characters/components, who are pretty simple, who's interactions with one another create something. I guess some of these games can be theoretically classifed as examples of emergence, but I think what differs is that most of these games either lack involved interactions, or don't really follow the idea of many simple things leading to something complex.
