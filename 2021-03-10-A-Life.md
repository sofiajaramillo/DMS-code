## Emergence

The first thing that came to my mind in terms of emergence was the general concept of ants, termites, and their colonies and mounds. I say this because of emergence seems pretty aplicable to how these tiny insects work. As tiny and simple creatures, each individual ant is not very important, only each having a specific job within the order of ant colonies. Each termite has a basic function, foraging, breeding, building, and each ant is probably unaware of what they're doing aside from the idea that they have to do it, it's their purpose. They are "coded" for their simple jobs, by who? who knows! 

But the interesting thing is that we, looking from the outside as more intelligent life forms, can identify and analyze what they do. Despite them doing simple work, all their efforts adds up to create a large intricate mound, with tons of tunnels, airways, crevices. Basically they all work together to create this large, complex and well designed system. And this is all without any of them knowing what they're doing. This is what I see as emergence, this concept of all this components having small jobs, actions, which all ultimately add up for a higher purpose, like all the cogs in a machine.

I find the topic of emergence still relevant when it comes to ants despite them being actual living things. I think despite emergence being more obvious to see in articial objects, like robots and a.i's, this concept of a higher purporse of being and doing can be applied to anything, regardless of if it's living or not. It really makes you wonder, if ants can achieve such a higher function while probably being unaware, do humans also have a higher function only visible to a higher being?
