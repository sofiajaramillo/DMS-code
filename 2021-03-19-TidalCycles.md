## TidalCycles

My experience with TidalCycles was, well, confusing and frustrating. 

I'm never been very good with music, despite being really interested in implementing music into art. I highly respect musicians for what they do, but I could not for the life of me understand the rules of music making. Anywhere from music theory, to how to tune a guitar, it just doesn't register with me.


I was hoping that the implementation of music making into a program akin to coding would be beneficial and appealing to me, but in hindsight, the experience left me a bit disappointed. The sudden introduction to a language that contained new elements that barely made sense to me was difficult. Not to imply that it's impossible to learn, but the aspects of this program were all so different and hard to tell apart. At the most basic levels, it made a bit more sense, but it just never got to a point where I could understand what was being made. It's as if the language suddenly made a leap in difficult right after introducing the elements of silence or pauses or simply "bp"s and "arpy"'s.

I only got to make a couple of simple sounds that I both understood and liked:

sound "[hh hh hh, sd cp sd cp, ~arpy*2]"

sound "[bd sd hh, arpy(1,3) drum, <~cp:1 ~cp:2> mt]"


And outside of that, as I only enjoyed a couple of sounds I found in the reference directory:

fastcat [sound "[hh hh hh, sd cp sd cp, arpy/2, arpy*2]"]

every 3 rev $ n "0 1 [~ 2] 3" # sound "arpy"


I don't know, as someone who likes to understand what I'm doing, it was very frustrating to work with a program that not only deals with a subject that I struggle with, but with a language that was completely foreign for me despite it's computer based setting.

I much preferred looking out the work I found outside of class. I obviously still couldn't understand the process, but the sounds being made impressed and made me question curiously how it was possible to make this with the elements I struggle with so much.

Overall, I do like the program of TidalCycles and the possibilities is provides in terms of computer music. It's sad, however, that outside from respect and admiration, I can't enjoy the process much, only as an outsider looking in.
