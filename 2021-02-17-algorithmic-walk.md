### My Algorithmic Walk

This is the Algorithm Walk intrusctinos I came up with:

Start

Start Nearest Intersection

Walk towards the direction in which the wind is blowing
(or where you think the wind is blowing)

Walk Forward until you encounter a corner/ End of block.

Cross whatever street is green (aka "Crossable"). If both street signs are green, cross to the street
straight in front of you/straight. If you can't cross any streets, continue walking on sidewalk until you
encounter next corner. 

Every time you spot a dog, turn next corner regardless of walk sign. (If you are a sociable person, walk towards the dog, maybe even cross the street so you can pet the dog) If you are successful in petting the dog, just continue walking where the wind is blowing (aka start back at step 1)

Once you have spotted or petted 3 dogs, you can go home.

(If no dogs are spotted after 20 minutes, start counting the first 3 people that walk on your general direction)

End

### Algorithmic Walk Reaction



So I tried the directions I came up with, and it went pretty well I think. I was a bit unsure of some of the directions being a bit vague, but I think it went fine. The walk lasted, like 27 minutes before I turned back, which was a good time.

I saw mainly a lot of snow. It was already getting a bit dark, but not too dark. I recommend doing this walk probably when it's brigher outside. A lot of the buildings I already knew, but I saw some nice houses here and there. Mostly buildings though.

The turning of the corners was pretty easy. I just walked forward for the first 10 minutes. Then I reached a couple of corners where I crossed the street to the left, and then to the right, and so forth. A few crossings/ end of blocks were a bit trickier in terms of their positions/turns, but for the post part I think the directions were simple enough for a city dweller.

There was some wind, although it was a bit hard to tell exactly in what direction it was coming from at first. I think I might want to change the directions so that one walks in the opposite direction of the wind, so that the wind doesn't blow directly in your face.

It was actually a bit fun to look for dogs while on my walk. It acutally took around 13 minutes until I started to see some dogs. I think where I live there a lot of dogs because it wasn't too hard to spot some dogs on my walk. Although maybe I was just a bit lucky today. I would recommend doing this walk in a city or near a park where dogs are easy to find.

I did notice that some roads are weirdly long around here, so I was mainly walking forward. If I had taken a turn towards the center of town, I probably would have taken a bit more corners. It was pretty calm and quite, which was nice, and it wasn't too cold.
