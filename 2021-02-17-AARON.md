## My Theoretical Tool

A theoretical tool could possibly be maybe a program that identifies the mistakes in a drawing and auto corrects them. Such as when you are drawing something, like a perfect circle, and the circle commes off as an ellipse, the program would then try to correct a side to make it more perfect. Or if you're drawing a perfect square and one of the sides is a bit too short or long, the program would identify this error and correct it.

In these intances, it would work more as a mathematical tool that assess when something is off in proportion, but it would be nice to have a tool that woks on a more theoretical basis to assess some of the less obvious mistakes done in art making. Let's say, for example, you are drawing a simple human figure, like the head, and the eyes are sort of off. In the sense that the size, position, and direction doen't look correct or how you like it. The program would theoretically assess the problem and find a way to fix it, or redraw it in a way that seems right to you.

In this intance, you would obviously have to tell the program/tool exactly how you would prefer it to look, because the tool wouldn't be able to know exactly what you're preferences are. Maybe in a mathematical or proportional sense, because I think that can be calculated, but personal appeal is less mathematical and more subjective. The cool thing would be that after enough input and practice, the program would slowly learn about your personal preferences, and adjust to correcting less obvious mistakes. Basically it would evolve enough to correct errors according to what it knows about your preferences and art style, if that makes any sense.
