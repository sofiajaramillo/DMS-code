## Final Project Prospective

### Proposal

What a trip, if I do say so myself. For brevity's sake, I'll just go through the steps of my process and my own thoughts while making writing my code.

Starting from the beginning, as in, my proposal, I stated clearly that my inspiration was a tamagotchi. Mainly the idea of creating a "living" that you take care of, or interact with in some way.

My main desire was to create a flock of creatures. A group on tiny weird creatures that one can control; basically they follow the the player.

You could place food on the screen, and the creature, first starting at only one, can eat it and reproduce. Reproducing as in the creature multiplies in numbers. In time you would have a crowd of creatures, in varying sizes, since eating the food also increases size.

In addition, I was also envisioning an element of zooming in. wherein as the crowd increases so does the canvas. This is to create an effect of a camera pulling out as the group increases in size. So at the start, it would feel more intimate, but as more creature increase, it would create this abstract feeling, like the crowd becoming less of creatures and more like a blob.

This would have played into the inheritance and other feature of my program. The reason as to why I wanted to have my creatures flock
